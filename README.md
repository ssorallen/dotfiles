This is a collection of my preferred settings mostly targeted at making
OS X pleasant for web development in Sublime Text 3, Git, and VIM.

## Installation

This uses [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) to symlink
various settings files to the proper locations. Where each settings file
will link is defined in "install.conf.yml".

1. `git clone https://github.com/ssorallen/dotfiles.git`
2. `./install`

### Setting Mac OS X Defaults

".osx" sets my preferred settings for OS X itself. The default `./install`
command does not run this because it can be expensive to run.

1. `./.osx`
